# Spring and REST

## Authors

## Project
We are building a Spring MVC prototype that allows us to enter in
music album information, save album objects to a database, and 
render album details to a show page via HTML 5 and the Spring MVC framework.

## Running our app
To run this application, follow the ordinary steps to clone down this repo, 
create a new database called albums in postgres, overwrite the postgres
username and password credentials in the projects application.properties 
folder to match your local details, and enter ./gradlew bootRun into 
the command line. Enter http://localhost:8080 into the nav bar in your
browser, and input data into the form located on the Albums page.
